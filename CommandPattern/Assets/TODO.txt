- Refactor
- Create a IA
- Create a level for this IA



Create Attack -> Double pattern?
Create Double Jump -> add condition to air state?
Create Levels
    Like Mario, but need to create a IA that plays automatically




PlayerState.cs
// How to handle 'empty' states? It will have?
// What about transition of states? Can I call it anywhere? Or should be in a 'late frame'?


PlayerController.cs
ChangeIdleState()
// TODO: Maybe add a Idle State because if the replay ends exactly a in part that is not
        // a ground, it will be able to move as ground in air.
